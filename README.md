# AR-Workshop:  Part 3
  Let's add some motion and transformation to our app.
  You previous had a node, we'd like to make it transformable in order to scale it and move it anywhere. -> Transformable node.

1. Make a subclass 'TransformableNode' and call it Animal. Overide any defaults.
  - Vector 3: a 3d location 
  - Quaternion: a Vector 3 + angular motion.

2. Let's try the linear motion animator: Vector3Evaluator()

3. Let's use the angular motion animator: QuaternionEvaluator()

3. ***Download the code in this repository and play with it. Replace the cow.sfb with any model you created. Ask questions please. 

Run it on your phone or simulator and scene the scene being created automatically for you.

Extra, go to [Edward's fun project](https://github.com/edward-sentongo/AR-Workshop-123), clone it and modify it the way you wish.
