# AR-Workshop:  Part 2

1. Theory:
    Node:
    Transformable Nodes:
    3d objects: OBJ, SFX, SFB etc
    Model:
    Model Renderable:
    Pose:
    Anchor:

2. Import objects
    @Project:
        app -> sampledata -> models
        main -> assets 
                sfb, sfa

    @Poly: https://poly.google.com/
    "cow", unzip obj, mtl and png to sampledata -> models.

3. Manipulate object characteristics:
    SFB - Materials[metallic, roughness, opacity, baseColorTint]
    SFB - Models [scale]


Run it on your phone or simulator and scene the scene being created automatically for you
