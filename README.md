# AR-Workshop
Beginners guide to Google's ARCore. Or let's just say Sceneform because it makes it straightforward to render realistic 3D scenes in AR and non-AR apps, without having to learn OpenGL.

Check out the branches and build on them or just go to the final app and make a pull request incase you have new features.
