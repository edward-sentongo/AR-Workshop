# AR-Workshop:  Part 3

Let's add some motion and transformation to our app.
You previous had a node, we'd like to make it transformable in order to scale it and move it anywhere. -> Transformable node.

1. Make a subclass 'TransformableNode' and call it Animal. Overide any defaults.
- Vector 3: a 3d location 
- Quaternion: a Vector 3 + angular motion.

2. Add taplisteners to the object and scene

3. Play around the code and see what else you can make your object to do.

Run it on your phone or simulator and scene the scene being created automatically for you.

Extra, go to [Edward's fun project](https://example.com), clone it and modify it the way you wish.
