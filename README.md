# AR-Workshop
Beginners guide to Google's ARCore. Or let's just say Sceneform because it makes it straightforward to render realistic 3D scenes in AR and non-AR apps, without having to learn OpenGL.

ARCore handles the following:
- Motion Tracking
- Environment Understanding
- Light Estimation

Since 3D rendering has a steep learning curve, we'll use an higher level API to build AR apps fast. 
Sceneform is high level 3D framework to make building AR apps in Java easy. It includes a runtime api which handles rendering and using arcore to make things work on the Android side. It also has a set of tools that interact with Android Studio to help you interact with your objects.


Check out the branches and build on them or just go to the final app and make a pull request incase you have new features.
